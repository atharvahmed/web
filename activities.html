                    <p class="card-text collapse mb-2" id="collapse1">A snowskate is a hybrid of a skateboard and a snowboard, intended primarily to allow for skateboard-style tricks on the snow. There are many types depending on the brand or style of snowskate.The first snowskate traces its history to the Snurfer circa 1964.[citation needed] The Snurfer is considered to be the first snowboard to ever hit the market, but it could arguably be called the first snowskate, since it was without bindings. Joshua Luther first coined the phrase snowskate when he needed a way to get across town during a blizzard.[citation needed]

                      Around 1970, a product called the "Snow Skate" was sold in local toy and sporting good stores. They resembled the modern day Fuse snowskate. There were two ski-like apparatuses that were attached to the area around the truck of a skateboard, allowing the skateboard to move through the snow. The "Ski" portion of the snow skate is made of a hard plastic with rubber straps that went over the skateboard wheels to hold them together. Other mentionable early snowskate brands were The "Skeeter" and the "Snodad".[citation needed] Designs of this early era ranged from two skiblades on the lower deck (Like the Skeeter) to four blades on the lower deck. Sometimes, the early snowskates used metal runners, similar to ice skate blades, enabling the snowskater to use the momentum to ride well.</p>

                    <p class="card-text collapse mb-2" id="collapse2">Swimmer Champ tourment for under 15,The 2023 World Para Swimming Championships was the 12th edition of the World Para Swimming Championships,[1] an international swimming competition for swimmers with disabilites. It was held in Manchester, Great Britain from 31 July to 6 August 2023. This was the third time that Great Britain have hosted the World Para Swimming Championships with Glasgow hosting in 2015 and London hosting in 2019.

                      The World Championships serves as a qualifier for the 2024 Summer Paralympics where two top swimmers in each individual medal event final will be automatically selected to compete at the Paralympics. As a swimmer can only hold one quota, which makes them eligible for all events in their classification for which they have a qualifying time, unrequired quotas are returned to be distributed later.A master’s student from The University of Manchester is to join the world’s elite para swimmers in Manchester  when she competes at the world championships this week.

                      Grace Harvey, a University of Manchester immunology graduate and now taking a  Masters in Public Health (Dental Public Health). , will be represent the British Para-Swimming team’ at the championships across three events.</p>

                    <p class="card-text collapse mb-2" id="collapse3">Snow Skating event etc,Winter sports or winter activities are competitive sports or non-competitive recreational activities which are played on snow or ice.[1] Most are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally, such games were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Playing areas and fields consist of either snow or ice.

                      Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey, para ice hockey, ringette, broomball, bandy, rink bandy, rinkball, and spongee in a milder climate. The sport of speed skating uses a frozen circular track of ice, but in some facilities the track is combined in an enclosed area used for sports requiring an ice rink or the rink itself is used. Alternatively, ice cross downhill uses a track with various levels of elevation and a combination of bends. Long distance skating (a.k.a. "marathon skating") such as tour skating is only performed outdoors and uses the available natural ice from frozen lakes, ponds, and marshes. Tour skating at times includes speed skaters, though tour skates are more common.
                      Common team sports include ice hockey, ringette, broomball (on either an indoor ice rink, or an outdoor ice rink or field of snow), curling, rinkball, and bandy. Based on the number of participants, ice hockey is the world's most popular winter team sport, followed by bandy</p>

                        <p class="card-text collapse mb-2" id="collapseFull1">Cycling tourment event etc,Road bicycle racing is the cycle sport discipline of road cycling, held primarily on paved roads. Road racing is the most popular professional form of bicycle racing, in terms of numbers of competitors, events and spectators. The two most common competition formats are mass start events, where riders start simultaneously (though sometimes with a handicap) and race to a set finish point; and time trials, where individual riders or teams race a course alone against the clock. Stage races or "tours" take multiple days, and consist of several mass-start or time-trial stages ridden consecutively.

                          Professional racing originated in Western Europe, centred in France, Spain, Italy and the Low Countries. Since the mid-1980s, the sport has diversified, with races held at the professional, semi-professional and amateur levels, worldwide. The sport is governed by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). As well as the UCI's annual World Championships for men and women, the biggest event is the Tour de France, a three-week race that can attract over 500,000 roadside supporters a day.</p>

The day when we spoke for the first time about going to a picnic, the adrenaline rush has been started flowing within us. The flow of happiness amongst the family was at its peak while preparing for the picnic. Everybody was excited about this outdoor adventure. Finally, the day had arrived. We all left our home and soon were on our way to the picnic.  The car was full of chatters. Every family member was so excited about the picnic with the family. All of us were in a totally different form.
