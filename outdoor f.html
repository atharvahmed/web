          <p class="abc">Cricket is played between two teams each made up of eleven players. (Sometime in junior competitions you will find 8 player teams).
            Games comprise of at least one innings where each team will take turns in batting and fielding/bowling.
            The fielding team will have a bowler bowl the ball to the batsman who tries to hit the ball with their bat.
            The fielding team tries to get the batsmen out by:
            Hitting the wickets with the ball when bowling
            Catching a batsman’s shot on the full
            Hitting the batsman’s leg in front of the wicket (LBW)
            Or hitting the wickets before the batsmen can run to the other end of the pitch
            The batmen try to score as many runs as possible before getting out by:
            Hitting the ball and running between the wickets and making it to the other end before the fielders can hit the wickets with the ball. Each time you run one full length of the pitch it equals 1 run.
            Hitting the ball to the boundary along the ground is 4 runs.
            Hitting the ball over the boundary on the full equals 6 runs.
            The fielding team must get 10 batsmen out before they can change over and start batting.
            The aim of the game is to score as many runs as possible before the fielding team takes 10 wickets. The team with the most runs wins. </p>

            <h5 class="abc">RULES OF FOOTBALL</h5>
            <p class="abc"> A match consists of two 45 minutes halves with a 15 minute rest period in between.
              Each team can have a minimum off 11 players (including 1 goalkeeper who is the only player allowed to handle the ball within the 18 yard box) and a minimum of 7 players are needed to constitute a match.
              The field must be made of either artificial or natural grass. The size of pitches is allowed to vary but must be within 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide. The pitch must also be marked with a rectangular shape around the outside showing out of bounds, two six yard boxes, two 18 yard boxes and a centre circle. A spot for a penalty placed 12 yards out of both goals and centre circle must also be visible.
              The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular shape.
              Each team can name up to 7 substitute players. Substitutions can be made at any time of the match with each team being able to make a maximum of 3 substitutions per side. In the event of all three substitutes being made and a player having to leave the field for injury the team will be forced to play without a replacement for that player.
              Each game must include one referee and two assistant referee’s (linesmen). It’s the job of the referee to act as time keeper and make any decisions which may need to be made such as fouls, free kicks, throw ins, penalties and added on time at the end of each half. The referee may consult the assistant referees at any time in the match regarding a decision. It’s the assistant referee’s job to spot offside’s in the match (see below), throw ins for either team and also assist the referee in all decision making processes where appropriate.
              If the game needs to head to extra time as a result of both teams being level in a match then 30 minutes will be added in the form of two 15 minute halves after the allotted 90 minutes.
              If teams are still level after extra time then a penalty shootout must take place.
              The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.
              For fouls committed a player could receive either a yellow or red card depending on the severity of the foul; this comes down to the referee’s discretion. The yellow is a warning and a red card is a dismissal of that player. Two yellow cards will equal one red. Once a player is sent off then they cannot be replaced.
              If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a throw in. If it goes out of play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal kick. If it comes off a defending player it is a corner kick.</p>

        <h4>Official Rules Of Hockey</h4>
        <p>Hockey is a kind of invasion game that is played by two teams of eleven players. Each team’s goal is to push a small and heavy hockey ball into their opposition’s goal. At the beginning of the game of hockey, after a coin toss to decide which team starts with the ball, the players pass from the line at the centre of the court.

          Hockey is a game of two halves that last 35 minutes each. The winner of the match is the team with the most goals by the end of the second half.</p>

              <h5 class="abc">RULES OF HOCKEY</h5>
              <p class="abc">Below are some basic rules of hockey you can use when teaching hockey to young children:

                Players can only hit the ball with the flat side of their stick.
                Hockey players (other than the goalkeeper) are not allowed to use their feet, or any other parts of the body, to control the ball at any time.
                You can only score a goal from inside the ‘striking circle’ in front of the opponent's goal. If the hockey ball is hit from outside the circle and goes into the goal, it doesn’t count.
                Hockey is a non-contact sport. This means that players are not allowed to push, trip, or physically touch an opponent. If this happens, the opposing team may be given a free hit or a ‘penalty corner’.</p>
