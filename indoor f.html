                <p class="abc">Each side of the table alternates serving two points at a time. EXCEPTION: After tied 10-10 (“deuce”), service alternates at every point. Can you lose on a serve in ping pong? Yes! There is no separate rule for serving on Game Point.</p>

It must hit your side of the table and then the other side. NOTE: Once the ball leaves the server’s hand it is in play, and so counts as the receiver’s point if the ball is missed or mis-hit. </p>

                        <p class="abc">Can the ball hit the net in ping pong? Yes, during a RALLY, if it touches the top of the net and then otherwise lands as a legitimate hit. BUT not when serving. If a served ball hits the net on the way over and otherwise legally bounces in play, it’s a “let” serve and is done over. There is no limit on how many times this can happen. </p>

                            <p class="abc">Can you hit the ball before it bounces in ping pong? No. In regular tennis you may “volley” the ball (hitting the ball before it bounces on your side of the net). But in table tennis, this results in a point for your opponent. NOTE: When your opponent hits a ball that sails over your end of the table without touching it and then hits you or your paddle, that is still your point.</p>

If the ball touches your PADDLE hand and otherwise results in a legal hit, there is no rule violation and play shall continue as normal. Your paddle hand includes all fingers and hand area below the wrist. But what if the ball touches a player’s body anywhere else during a ping pong rally? You may not touch the ball with your non-paddle hand for any reason. It will result in a point for your opponent. BUT if  your opponent’s hit sails over your side of the table without touching it, and hits any part of you or your paddle, that is still your point. </p>

      <h4>Official Rules Of Karate</h4>
      <p>Karate is a martial art that originated in Okinawa with its history being able to be traced back to the 1300s. Brought to mainland Japan in the early 20th century, it has become one of the world’s most popular martial arts and has developed several different styles including Shotokan, Goju-Ryu, Kyokushinkai and Wado-Ryu.

        Karate, unlike Japanese Judo is primarily a striking art and involves the use of punches, kicks, knee and elbow strikes and various other striking techniques. Some forms of karate may also include a small amount of throws, joint locks and grappling, though it is as an exciting striking art that Karate is known.</p>

          <p class="abc">Karate Kumite matches take place on a matted square of 8m x 8m with an additional 1m on all sides that is called the safety area.
            Once the referee and judges have taken their places, competitors should exchange bows.
            The fight starts when the referee shouts “SHOBU HAJIME!”
            Both fighters should attempt scoring techniques (punches, kicks and throws) on their opponent. These are classified as Yuko, Waza-ari and Ippon and are one, two and three points respectively.
            If the referee deems a scoring technique may have been used, the referee shouts YAME and the contestants, judges and referee all resume their original positions.
            The judges will then indicate their opinion by means of a signal and if a score is to be awarded, the referee identifies the contents and the area that they attacked and then awards them the relevant socire (Yuko, Waza-ari or Ippon) and then restarts the bout by shouting “TSUZUKETE HAJIME!”
            If one competitor establishes a clear lead of eight points during a match, then the referee calls a halt to the bout and declares them the winner.
            If no competitor establishes a clear lead of eight points during the fight, then the fighter who has the most points is declared the winner.
            In the event of the points being level, the referee and the judges will decide who is the winner of the bout.
            Fights can end earlier if one competitor is knocked down and is not in a position to carry on or if one fighter is disqualified. </p>

      <h4>Official Rules Of Boxing</h4>
      <p>In essence boxing may well be the world’s oldest sport. At its most basic it is fighting and since there has been man, there has been conflict. It is certainly at least as old as 688 BC when it was included in the ancient Olympic Games, although more regulated, codified versions of boxing date to about the 1500s. Having said that, carvings dating to the 3rd millennium BC show people fist-fighting in front of audiences so it is safe to say the art of pugilism is an ancient one indeed.</p>
